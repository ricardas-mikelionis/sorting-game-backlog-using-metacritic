# Using Metacritic and HowLongToBeat data to determine which games from my backlog are worth playing
This is a personal problem that every gamer faces at some point. Currently I own over 500 video games on 18 different platforms and storefronts in both physical and digital. Picking out a new game to play is becoming a daunting task so I've decided to use data from Metacritic, mainly Critic reviews, and the number of said reviews as well as average length of a playthrough as provided by HowLongToBeat to determine which of my games are worth playing.
