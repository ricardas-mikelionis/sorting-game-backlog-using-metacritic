Unfortunately there are a number of games that contain 0 reviews and have a score of 0. In some cases there is simply no page for the game on metacritic. For example I own an original copy of Assassin's Creed on PC however metacritic does not have a page for the original version of the game, and only has a Director's cut re-release page. I would consider these different enough and do not want to use one score to fill in gaps in the other, so I'll leave them as 0 for now. \n",

    "Now as all of the necessary values are calculated I can start using them to determine the entertainment value of each game. My first idea was to simply calculate an average of the three. However this simple approach proved to have an interesting problem. Length of the game when normalized favours long games, meaning the longer the game is the higher the normalized value, the more skewed towards longer games the entertainment value score is. And while yes, a 100hr. game with a critic score of 97, would technically have more entertainment value than say 10 hour game which scored a 90, I wouldn't necessarily want to play say 5 100h. or longer games in a row.\n",

    "A solution for this problem is to give weights to the scores. I've chosen the critics score to be the most important making up 50% of the final value, second most important was number of reviews at 30% value. Number of reviews are important as I feel that game with a score of 99 and only 4 reviews is not as accurately represented as a game with a score of 80, but over 100 reviews. Lastly making up 20% of the final score is the length of the playthrough, and while it is still favouring longer games, this way the impact of length to calculated entertainment value is lessened."
